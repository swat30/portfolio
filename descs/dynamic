<p>Dynamic Hosting has been around since 2000 and is a partner company with Norex Web Development. They provide hosting solutions for all levels of clientele, including personal, small, and large business services. Their previous website was very outdated and was falling behind the current standards in the industry. After several attempts to outsource the development to other firms across the globe, Dynamic Hosting decided to do it internally with Norex. One of the main goals of the site is to promote environmental sustainability through carbon offsets. It gives clients the assurance that Dynamic Hosting is aware of the current situation with our surroundings and is taking action. </p>
<p>This site was very e-commerce heavy, as the entire purpose of it was to sell web-hosting services. It required some tweaking of our existing E-Commerce module for the Norex Dashboard content management system. This involved plugin development to account for hosting services, as they had different needs than other items. Also, I was required to port over some old CSS meant for a different CMS to meet the standards of Dashboard's templating system, Smarty.</p>
