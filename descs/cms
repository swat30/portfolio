<p>Norex's Dashboard content management system (CMS) has been under development since the early 2000's, but was redeveloped in 2007 by Christopher Troup. This new version, which is still the core driving the CMS today, was made to replace old PHP4 style coding with the more up-to-date, PHP5 object oriented programming structure. Norex uses this product as the backbone to nearly all of their web development, using it to build all of their client's websites. In early 2009, the Dashboard CMS was deemed an open-source project, allowing the entire web community to begin contributing their ideas through collaborative development.</p>
<p>During my first week of employment at Norex, I was asked to redevelop the Photo Gallery module for Dashboard. It had initially been developed by another potential hire, but was not working properly. I quickly picked up on the framework of the CMS and was able to develop a pretty stable module. Since then, I have been both contributing to the Dashboard project, and using it to create client websites. This kind of work was my first in the PHP object oriented style and I have a hard time going back to my old procedural style. It was definitely a key learning point in my web development career, opening me up to a more modern and efficient way of working.</p>
