Ennsett Environmental is a group that provides environmental offsets to individuals and businesses, as well as funding research and projects with their profits. They give people the chance to help cleanup the environment and reduce their carbon footprint.
This site was elegantly designed by Justin Bellefontaine, a graphic artist at Queen Street Studios at the time. The programming side showcases some basic skills which I acquired during my time at Norex. Most noteably, the Projects section was one of my first custom javascripts using Prototype and Scriptaculous. Although it does not appear to be anything overly significant, it allowed me to become familiar with those APIs and sparked an interest in using them to make sites more intuitive and interactive.
