<p>Doug Bragg Enterprises is a company based in rural Nova Scotia. They sell machinery and electronics for harvesting and farming. They were one of my first clients with Norex in July of 2008, so the development of this website was a good learning experience for me. Although it was basic as far as features were concerned, it allowed me to become more familiar with both the Dashboard CMS, as well as dealing with clients.</p>
<p>This project required little custom work, so it gave me a chance to further explore the inner workings of our CMS. However, I did develop a small module to allow their clients to browse used equipment. It didn't require any E-commerce, so it was rather uncomplicated, but furthered my module and object oriented development skills.</p>
