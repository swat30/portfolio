Ennsett Environmental is a group that provides environmental offsets to individuals and businesses, as well as funding research and projects with their profits. They give people the chance to help cleanup the environment and reduce their carbon footprint.
This site was elegantly designed by Justin Bellefontaine, a graphic artist at Queen Street Studios at the time. The programming side showcases some basic skills which I acquired during my time at Norex. Most noteably, the Projects section was one of my first custom javascripts using Prototype and Scriptaculous. Although it does not appear to be anything overly significant, it allowed me to become familiar with those APIs and sparked an interest in using them to make sites more intuitive and interactive.
During the progress of programming Ennsett's site, I had the pleasure of working with Bob Munro, one of the group's creators. I came to realize that when dealing with clients, they will give you with the same respect that you give them. I built a good client relationship with Bob, causing the development process to go smoothly, even when there were descrepencies in what he had envisioned and what I had created. Upon the site's completion, Bob was so pleased with how the process went, he offered to do part-time sales for Norex. Not only did I have an enjoyable experience, I also learned how being good to a client can pay off for both sides.
