<p>Safeballot was arguably one of my most interesting projects for Norex in 2008. It is owned internally and was developed to be a service that is sold to clients on a per-user basis. The site serves a seemingly simple purpose: to provide groups and organizations with a reliable, secure voting system hosted by a third party to ensure confidentiality of voters. The idea for Safeballot originated from a request by the Halifax Professional Firefighters Association, who wanted the system so they wouldn't have to setup ballot stations all over the province every time they wanted to have a vote.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge in the development of Safeballot was its demand for security. When providing users with the opportunity to place a vote online, they want to know that their vote is confidential. This involved setting up a hash system that disassociated every vote from the voter, yet at the same time, ensuring that the data was their in case of an audit of some sort. Database structuring skills were critical to providing this kind of confidence. Using PHP and MySQL, along with an SSL Certificate, I was able to secure voting data both during and after votes were cast.</p>
<p>Not only was there a demand for security for the front-end user, providing an easy-to-use interface for the administrator was also a key aspect of this service. Although the administrative back-end is based on Norex's dashboard Content Management System (CMS), the voting system was essentially done from scratch. Using the Prototype and Scriptaculous javascript libraries, I developed an intuitive management system for clients. This involved allowing them to easily create, edit, and archive campaigns, manage voters, view results, and print hash-code sheets for clients without an e-mail address.
