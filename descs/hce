<p>From their website: "Founded in 1981, High-Crest Enterprises Ltd. is a leader in providing quality healthcare to seniors in Nova Scotia. Presently operating five facilities, it is one the largest providers of health care in the province. High-Crest offers nursing homes in Springhill and Sherbrooke, seniors residential care in Antigonish and New Glasgow, and a second residential care facility in downtown New Glasgow."</p>
<p>This website, which I began working on in mid-July 2008, was also amongst one of my first at Norex. It was another important experience while building my object oriented programming skill set. I was simultaneously improving the photo gallery module that I had built only a week or so before. Highcrest also helped me improve on my quality control standards, as I had realized that I had made some mistakes while developing the photo gallery which could have easily been avoided with little testing.</p>
