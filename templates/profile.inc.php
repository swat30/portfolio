<h2>my story</h2>
<p>My interest in making websites was sparked at a fairly young age. I was taking swimming lessons from a guy named Nick who was a computer science
student at Mount Saint Vincent Univiersity. He used to give me copies of code examples and references to HTML, which I vigourisly duplicated
at home after every lesson.</p>
<p>After coding simple HTML sites for a year or two, I found that static content was getting boring for me. I urged my parents to buy me a 
PHP/MySQL book so that I could learn the wonders of dynamic content. I used the book to learn the basics of programming in PHP using MySQL for 
data storage, which I really enjoyed.</p>

<p>At the age of 15, I was pretty familiar with HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL. My cousin, Andrew Prestidge, was picking up Adobe Photoshop at the time
and we decided that we could make a little money. We developed small sites, mostly for online gamers, and didn't really make that much, but it was 
a great experience which definitely led me to where I am today.</p>
<p>The end of my last year of high school was monumental in my web development career. I got a job at Norex, a small web development firm not far
from Halifax, as a web developer and support technitian.</p>
